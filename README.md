Design Process

The main aim for BunnyBae was to make it simplstic for the older generation yet fun at the same time for the younger generation hence the bright colours and animations within the app. The simple design was mainly aimed towards the older generation as technology continues to improve, we must also understand others might have a hard time coping. The app mainly has 2-3 columns to cater to mobile use and to easily categorize the differnent products for easy viewing. The use of bright colour is meant to add a pop of colour to attract younger audiences as well as the use of white spaces to give the eyes a resting place once in a while. Small animations here and there are meant for the user to have some form of mircointeraction. 


Features

Light and Dark Mode are for users to prefer having a theme to thier app, while some may like the white background, some prefer a darker background. This gives them the option to personalize the app to thier liking. The dark mode background isnt entirely black as well but instead a greyish tone as studies show, too much of difference bewteen black and white cause irritation to the eyes hence the decision to use a greyish background which also complements yellow, our mainly primary colour. Nav bar with moving animation, instead of a staic navbar we decided to add some lottie animations to it to make it more interactive and fun to look at it. It gives the page some life instead of it always being static. 


Technologies Used

Adobe XD - to construct the wireframe of the website HTML - used to code the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements CSS - used to define styles of the web pages, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. Javascript - used to create interactive navigation bar.Mainly used restdb.io to store users information as it is easier to use and also easy to keep track in the website server itself. It can also contain sensitive information in the server safe without any unknown 
authority stealing the information as the account is only for your own special server.


Testing

i. Mainly tested out if the server manage to capture any data from users input
ii. tested multiple times if server able to capture any data
